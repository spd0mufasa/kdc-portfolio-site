# AI System Project

This project is a backend-first, architecture-heavy system designed to ingest, process, and retrieve medical documents securely for multiple users. It includes:

- A multi-user ingestion pipeline  
- A vector-database-powered semantic retrieval engine  
- A secure API layer for agents  
- A future GUI for interacting with the system  

## Explore the Project

### 1. [Web Medical System (UI/GUI)](./web-medical-system/)
The user interface layer — built last. This will allow users to upload documents, view their data, and interact with agents.

### 2. [API Ingestion Layer](./api-ingestion/)
The API endpoints that allow ingestion, retrieval, user management, and agent access.

### 3. [AI Ingestion & Retrieval Engine](./ai-ingestion/)
The core engineering work: architecture, ingestion pipeline, vector DB, services, containers, metadata schema, and multi-environment design.
